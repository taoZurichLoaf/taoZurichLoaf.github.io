Hi! It's Tao Peng 彭<a href='https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.93.4'>涛</a>.


I’m a graduate student advised by Prof. [Yoo Min Park](https://www2.yoominpark.com/about) at the Department of Geography, Sustainability, Community, and Urban Studies of the University of Connecticut. 


I was mentored by Prof. [Cheng FU](https://cfu1.github.io/) and Prof. [Robert WEIBEL](https://user.geo.uzh.ch/rweibe/) at the [GIS Group](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/gis.html) of the University of Zurich. 
During my study in Zurich, I also worked as a research assistant supervised by Prof. [Judit Lienert](https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/judit-lienert/show/) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG). Before that, I studied Urban Planning at Wuhan University.
